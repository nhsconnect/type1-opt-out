# NHS Type 1 Opt-Out Online Option

Patients in England can stop their GP data being used for purposes other than their direct care by completing a Type 1 Opt-out form MS Word document, and then sending it to their GP by email, post or in person.

This puts an extra burden on GP practices. NHS Digital will lighten this load by handling Type 1 opt-outs.

This app will let citizens authenticate and set their Type 1 opt-out preference, which will then be sent to the GP System Supplier of their GP Practice and registered against their GP record.
